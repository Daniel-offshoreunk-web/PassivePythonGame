This is just a game I tried to make in python(aka I don't have much hope for it). I would really like it if someone was able to playtest it (even if you might need a compiler) and give some feedback or just suggestions of what to add. I plan to eventually make a .exe version of this to make it easier to play, but for now it's in beta and it would be really hard to update it becaus eI would have to replace the exe. If you want to make changes to it thats all fine and if you think you made a better version just send the changes you made.
